 Requirement Analysis
2.1 Functional Requirements
Caption Extraction:

Description: Extract all captions from Facebook posts using Selenium WebDriver for activities like student events, faculty training, and workshops.
Input: Facebook login credentials and user profile URL.
Output: Captions extracted from posts in text format.
Constraints: Handling dynamic web content, scroll loading, and ensuring no duplication in extraction.
Activity Classification:

Description: Automatically classify extracted captions into predefined categories (e.g., student activity, training program, placement event).
Input: Extracted captions.
Output: Categorized activities (e.g., "student activity," "faculty training," etc.).
Constraints: NLP-based classification model with an accuracy threshold of at least 85%.
NLP-Based Data Structuring:

Description: Use NLP techniques to extract and organize relevant information (such as event date, duration, and guide) from captions.
Input: Classified captions.
Output: A structured table (CSV/Excel format) with columns such as:
Event Name/Activity
Event Date
Duration
Guide/Organizer
Additional Details (optional)
Constraints: NLP libraries should correctly identify and extract key information from unstructured text, ensuring that each required field is filled.
Storage and Output:

Description: Store the extracted and classified data in a structured format for easy access and further analysis.
Output: CSV/Excel file containing the structured event data.
Constraints: Ensure no data loss or duplication during the data storage process.
2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must handle large volumes of posts (up to 500 posts) efficiently.
Caption extraction, classification, and data structuring should not take more than 10 seconds per post.
Scalability:

The system should be able to process an increasing number of posts as the user’s Facebook activity grows.
Modular design to allow future enhancements (e.g., support for other social media platforms).
Security:

User credentials must be handled securely during login and data extraction.
Use encrypted storage or secure APIs (e.g., Facebook Graph API) for authentication and data access.
Reliability:

The system should be reliable even in cases of dynamic page changes or unexpected webpage behavior.
Implement error handling to manage issues like network connectivity problems or changes in Facebook’s DOM structure.
Usability:

The interface (command-line or GUI) should be user-friendly, allowing non-technical users to easily run the extraction and classification processes.
Maintainability:

The codebase should be modular and well-documented to facilitate easy maintenance and future upgrades (e.g., integrating advanced NLP models).
Portability:

The solution should be cross-platform, capable of running on different operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS).
Minimal hardware requirements for running the web scraping and NLP components.
3. Hardware & Software Requirements
3.1 Hardware Requirements
Processor: Multi-core CPU (Intel i5 or equivalent).
RAM: At least 8 GB for running multiple browser instances.
Storage: Sufficient disk space (minimum 500 MB) to store extracted data and temporary files.
3.2 Software Requirements
Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
Programming Language: Python (3.x).
Web Scraping Library: Selenium WebDriver.
NLP Libraries:
spaCy or NLTK for natural language processing tasks.
Data Handling: Pandas for managing structured data.
Web Browser: Chrome (with Chromedriver) for Selenium automation.
API Integration (optional): Facebook Graph API for future enhancements.
4. System Design
4.1 System Components:
Web Scraping Component:

Automated extraction of captions using Selenium.
Classification Component:

Use a pre-trained machine learning model or rule-based classifier to categorize captions into predefined activity types.
NLP Component:

Apply NLP to extract structured information (event name, date, etc.) from the captions.
Data Output Component:

Save the classified and structured data in a table format (CSV/Excel).
5. Assumptions and Dependencies
The user will provide valid Facebook credentials to log in for data extraction.
The Facebook page structure remains consistent; any significant changes may require script adjustments.
Internet connectivity is required for accessing Facebook and downloading data.
